# PowerShell_Scripts
PowerShell script projects of mine (personal projects), meant to furhter advance my understanding of PowerShell and the Windows environment.
Please note that these scripts can be very "crude", as I am stil honing my PowerShell Script-Fu.

As such, these scripts are evolving projects, and will continue to receive updates to the code as I learn and grow.
Please feel free to leave any questions, comments, requests or suggestions!

(powershell_updates.ps1) TASKS (a/o 03/18/2025):
  + Refine functions to reduce redundancy (where possible)
  + Add CLI menu for easy use
  + Add Chocolatey update functions
  + Add feature where script will detect if Windows host has available update options (PSWindowsUpdate, WinGet, Chocolatey, etc.) and run updates as needed.
  + Add proper error handling
      - Side-note: Possible feature to output suggested fix for common issues.
